<b> Basics of the web</b>
<p> The web contains: the web, HTML, URLs, HTTP, 
and Web apps. Major pieces are your computer + browser (IE, 
  Firefox), internet cloud, and servers. The internet uses a
  protocol of HTTP to send/receive messages. Your computer send a 
  <b>HTTP</b> request to <em>web server</em> then <em>server</em>
  return the document coded in <em>HTML</em>which your <em> web
  browser</em> then displays to your screen.

  does a good job of explaining.

  <b>HTML</b>
  <p>Hypertext Markup Language is the most common coding used 
  on the web. It has two parts to it, <em><b>TEXT</b></em> which is 
  actually the written words you see and <b><em>MARKUP</em></b> which 
  gives style to the contents. There can be references to images or 
  other pages.
  </p>

  <b>Principle parts of HTML</b>

  <p>There are <em>tags</em> which most require an opening tag and a 
  closing tag with content between them, such as <b>Bold</b> or
  <b>Emphasis</b>. As you can tell the tags can define how the
  content looks.The tags along with the content are called an <em>
  element</em>. There are several different tags such as <b>
  Anchor</b> which reference a hyper-link. The <b>Image</b> tag will
  allow you to define a URL however it doesn't require a closing tag.
  The <b>Break</b> tag will allow you to add white space to the screen.
    </p>
  <b>Types of Elements</b>
  <p>There are two types of elements <em>inline</em> and <em>block</em>.
  The block elements have an invisible box around the contents and seen 
  here by the paragraphs.
